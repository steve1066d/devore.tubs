# Ordering Options

The following prices are for customers in the USA.  Please contact me pricing for other locations.

### Replacing the microcontroller on a working board
If you have a currently working board, and wish to upgrade, the cost is $80, including shipping in the USA.
This includes a full test of the board and its power supply to ensure the board will continue to work.
The microcontroller and program are backed with a 1-year warranty.  Also, if a board fails within a year for some reason, 
the price of this upgrade can be applied to a future rebuilding of the board. 

### Rebuilding the board
If you are going to go through the trouble to remove and replace the contol board, it would be wise to consider getting it rebuilt at the same time.
Or if a board is not working correctly, rebuilding it will restore it to good working order.
Both power power relays and the electrolytic capacitors will be replaced, along with any other needed parts. The cost is $200

### Rebuilding the board, including a new power supply
The power supply on the Softub boards, especially the C-2013 boards can have issues. Often problems can be fixed with replacing some components, but sometimes the power supply needs to be replaced entirely.
To do this, the board is modified to use a high-quality power supply, engineered to handle the heat of the enclosure.  The cost for this is $250.

### What boards can be upgraded
Any digital board (C-2001, C-2003, C-2006, or C-2013) can be upgraded, as long as there isn't physical damage to the board. (If there is concern, send me some photos of the board before sending it in).
Even if you were told that your board wasn't fixable, it very likely can be now, as almost all parts can now be replaced. If a board turns out to not be fixable, there is no charge.

### Buying the microcontoller chip.
The chip itself can be purchased for $50, which can be installed by someone qualified to do board level electronic repairs.

### Warranty
Each upgrade has a one-year warranty.  See the [warranty page](warranty.html) for details

### Wi-Fi adapter board
The modified board supports working with a smart swtich, to integrate it with Wi-Fi as a smart device.  However, Softub uses 5 volt logic, and most home automatition devices expect 3.3 volts.
The Wi-Fi adapter does the voltage translation, along with making an easy way of connecting the Shelly or Sonoff.
The cost is $50.  See [this page](wifi.html) for details.
